## Overview

The goal is to construct **prediction intervals** for the **treatment effect**:

$$
\text{ITE}(\mathbf{x}) = Y(1;\mathbf{x}) - Y(0;\mathbf{x})
$$

We assume the data-generating model:

$$
Y = c(\mathbf{x}) + T \cdot \tau(\mathbf{x}) + \sigma Z,
$$

where $c(\mathbf{x})$: baseline function, $\tau(\mathbf{x})$: treatment effect function, $\sigma$: noise scale and $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$

These components are modeled using deep neural networks:

- The **c-network** models $c(\mathbf{x})$ with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_c$
- The **$\tau$-network** models $\tau(\mathbf{x})$ with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}_\tau$
- The **inverse network** models the mapping $\boldsymbol{\theta} = g(y, T, \mathbf{x}, z)$ with parameters $\mathbf{w}_n$

Note. Although the method involves several neural networks, **only the parameters $\mathbf{w}_n$ of the inverse network are directly updated** via EFI framework. For EFI, please refer [Extended Fiducial Inference: Toward an Automated Process of Statistical Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21622) and related [code](https://github.com/sehwankimstat/EFI). The parameters of the c- and $\tau$-networks are **derived** from $\mathbf{w}_n$ from $g(y, T, \mathbf{x}, z)$. 

## Constructing Prediction Intervals for ITE

For the $k$-th iteration of the EFI algorithm, a new set of parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(k)}$ is imputed from the inverse network, producing a different realization of the treatment effect.

Given a test set of size $n_{\text{test}}$, each subject falls into one of the following categories:

### 1. Case: Control Outcome Observed ( $i \in \mathcal{I}_c$ )

- Observed: $Y_i^{obs}(0)$ and $x_i$
- Simulate:

$$
\hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(1) = \hat{c}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}_i) + \hat{\tau}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}_i) + \hat{\sigma}^{(k)} Z^{(k,1)}, \quad Z^{(k,1)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

- Compute prediction interval for:

$$
\hat{Y}_i(1)^{(k)} - Y_i^{obs}(0),\quad \text{for } k=1,\ldots,K 
$$

### 2. Case: Treatment Outcome Observed ( $i \in \mathcal{I}_t$ )

- Observed: \( Y_i^{obs}(1) \) and $x_i$
- Simulate:
  
$$
\hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(0) = \hat{c}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}_i) + \hat{\sigma}^{(k)} Z^{(k,2)}, \quad Z^{(k,2)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

- Compute prediction interval for:

$$
Y_i^{obs}(1) - \hat{Y}_i(0)^{(k)},\quad \text{for } k=1,\ldots,K 
$$

### 3. Case: Only Covariates Observed ( $i \in \mathcal{I}_m$ )

- Observed: Only $x_i$
- Simulate:
  
$$
\hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(1) - \hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(0) = \hat{\tau}^{(k)}(\mathbf{x}_i) + \sqrt{2} \hat{\sigma}^{(k)} Z^{(k,3)}, \quad Z^{(k,3)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

- Compute prediction interval directly for:

$$
\hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(1) - \hat{Y}_i^{(k)}(0),\quad \text{for } k=1,\ldots,K 
$$

## Results

The notebook `DoubleNN_nonlinear_nonlinear.ipynb`.describes the application of Double NN to the nonlinear $c(\cdot)$ and nonlinear $\tau(\cdot)$. Please refer Section 5 at [Extended Fiducial Inference for Individual Treatment Effects via Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01995) for further detail.

The above figure presents the results of Double-NN: (left) a scatter plot of $\hat{z}_{i}$ (y-axis) versus $z_i$ (x-axis), (middle-left) a Q-Q plot of $\hat{z}_i$ and $z_i$, (middle-right) scatter plot of $\tau(x)$ and $\hat{\tau}(x)$ , and (right) scatter plot of $c(x)$ and $\hat{c}(x)$

The left panel shows that the imputed random errors closely match the true random errors. The middle-left panel demonstrates that the imputed errors exhibit a distributional behavior similar to that of the true errors. The middle-right and right panels indicate that neural networks trained using the Double-NN method can accurately estimate the true response surface. By collecting these values across iterations, one can construct confidence or prediction intervals for $c(\cdot)$ and $\tau(\cdot)$.
